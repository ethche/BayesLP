# BayesLP

This project uses the connection made between optimal transport and Bayesian Persuasion in  Kolotilin (2018) to identify and visualize optimal information mechanisms. Please see the notebook "Bayes_LP.ipynb" for details concerning the communication game of the paper.

The linear programming approach in this paper, under certain circumstances, allows us to explicitly compute optimal mechanisms as the solution of a transportation problem, in situations where concavification does not easily generate a concrete solution.

This is the optimal information mechanism when
